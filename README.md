# Use Genetic Programming Algorithm Evolve a Greedy Snake
  I wrote this program many years ago, now I put it on GitHub.
  The main idea is from the article: <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/artificial-intelligence/application-of-genetic-programming-to-the-snake-r1175">Application of Genetic Programming to the Snake Game</a>. <br>
  Based on the idea, I wrote the source code in Java.<br>
  After many generations evolving, this app will base on very basic "syntax node", automatic evolve a "<b>best program</b>" for snake to follow.<br>
  The higher the "<b>Best score</b>", the "<b>Smarter</b>" the snake is.<br>
  The main class is: gui/EvolveGreedySnake.java. <br>
  You can also directly run the "Snake.jar" file.</span>
